# Observation Helper
A group of methods and functions written to make analysis of data from AstroImageJ quicker &amp; easier in Python, especially analysis of CCD images of periodically variable objects. This project is mainly targeted at students who are using AstroImageJ for an observational astronomy project.

These classes and functions were developed while conduncting my senior Capstone Project for my undergraduate physics degree at Rochester Institute of Technology. My project was about variable stars, and I was using AstroImageJ to clean and photometer CCD images. These classes and methods can help students using AstroImageJ for similar projects to organize and quickly plot data from AstroImageJ files.
